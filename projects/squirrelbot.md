        <p class="lead-paragraph">
          The Squirrelbot is a charming weekend robotics project that demonstrates the intersection of biomimetic design and creative engineering. This hand-made mini robot captures the essence of squirrel movement, showcasing how natural motion can inspire robotic design.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Built entirely by hand over a weekend, the Squirrelbot represents the joy of engineering creativity and the satisfaction of bringing an idea to life. The project explores biomimetic principles by studying and replicating the unique movement patterns of squirrels in a compact robotic form.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          The project was inspired by observing squirrels' distinctive movement patterns - their quick, darting motions and characteristic way of pausing and scanning their environment. The challenge was to capture this essence in a simple, hand-built mechanical system.
