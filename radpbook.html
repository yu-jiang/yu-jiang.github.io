<h1> Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming </h1>
Welcome to the webpage of the book "Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming", written by Yu Jiang and Zhong-Ping Jiang. This webpage is created to provide lastest news and supplementary materials related to the book, such as source code that can reproduce the numerical examples covered in the book.

<h2> Disclaimer (12/4/2016) </h2>
I am a Software Engineer with the Controls Toolbox Team at MathWorks, and most likely will hold the same position at the time the book is published. 
However, I should note that this book is not sponsered by MathWorks. It is entirely based on my paper
submitted and/or published during my PhD at the New York University. The MATLAB/Simulink-based simulations were originally created during that period. Hence, 
during my PhD. They are not products of MathWorks, and do not contain any intellectual property of the company.

<h2> News </h2>
The book is currently with the publisher.

<h2> Numerical Examples </h2>
All the source code is available to download via the following links.
They are developed and maintained on GitHub. <br>
