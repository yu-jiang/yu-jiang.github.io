You’ve probably seen skateboarders in a half-pipe, generating speed not by pushing off the ground, but by skillfully shifting their weight up and down. This motion—called “pumping”—lets them accelerate without any external force. Inspired by this, we asked an interesting question: If a human on a skateboard can gain speed without an engine, can a vehicle with an active suspension system do the same? 

In our recent research work, led by Zhaodong Zhou (Oakland University) in collaboration with Prof. Jun Chen and myself (ClearMotion), we provided an answer: yes, it’s possible. By actively modulating suspension movements in sync with road geometry—just like a skater’s rhythm—a car can increase its speed while descending, without any extra engine power. This idea of “vehicular pumping” could open up new possibilities in energy efficiency and advanced suspension design. 

We’re excited that this work has been accepted to the 12th IFAC Symposium on Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV 2025).
