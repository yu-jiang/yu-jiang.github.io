Yesterday was my last day at ClearMotion as a fulltime employee. I am so proud of what our team has achieved in the past 19 months. By incorporating data science and AI elements into active suspension controls, we changed the ride to a new level. This has been the first time in my research career that complex control and learning theories really made a difference in physical systems. I gained enormous sense of achievement from the work.

As the theoretical framework and the software foundation have been established, I am confident that the technology will soon be polished and commercialized into products in the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, I believe this is the right time for me to move on. I have decided to join in iSee AI, and will be starting next week to work on control problems in autonomous driving. I am excited to face new challenges and to make new contributions. Let the new journey begin.
