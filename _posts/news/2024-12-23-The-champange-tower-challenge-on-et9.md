As a controls researcher, it’s incredibly fulfilling to see our active suspension technology now in production in NIO’s flagship ET9. At this moment, I realize how the mathematical theories I’ve studied—algebra, differential equations, complex analysis, and control theories like linear systems, robust control, optimal control, output regulation, and adaptive dynamic programming—could come together to create something tangible. I hope many of my colleagues in the controls community can share in this excitement.
