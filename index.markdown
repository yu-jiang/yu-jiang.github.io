# About Me
[comment]: # (Life)
- I have been living in the beautiful suburbs of Greater Boston for over 10 years with my wonderful family. Before settling in Massachusetts, I spent five years in New York City completing my PhD. Prior to that, I attended college at Sun Yat-sen University and pursued graduate studies at South China University of Technology.

[comment]: # (Educational)
- I earned a PhD in Electrical Engineering (Control Theory) from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu). My doctoral research focused on integrating reinforcement learning with nonlinear control theory for diverse applications. For more details, see my [publications]({{site.url}}/publications/).

[comment]: # (Industry)
- With over a decade of industry experience, I began my career at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com), working as a Software Engineer on the controls toolbox team. Later, I became the Tech Lead of the controls team at the autonomous trucking company [ISEE AI](https://www.isee.ai), an MIT spinout. Currently, I serve as a Senior Technical Scientist in the CTO-office at [ClearMotion](https://www.clearmotion.com), specializing in motion planning and control for intelligent vehicles.

[comment]: # (Acamedia Research)
- Beyond my industry work, I am deeply involved in academic research, regularly publishing articles and reviewing for journals and conferences. I previously served on the editorial board of the renowned IFAC journal Control Engineering Practice (CEP).

[comment]: # (Consulting)
- Since early 2020, I have been working as a part-time technical consultant and advisor for tech startups, helping them navigate complex technical challenges.
