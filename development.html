<h1> Simulink Control Design </h1>
<p>Below are a list of new features or enhancements I developed for Simulink Control Design at MathWorks. For details, please refer to
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/release-notes.html">the official release notes</a>.</p>
<h2> R2017a </h2>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>Custom Constraints and Objective Functions for Trimming Simulink Models: Calculate operating points with increased flexibility
  <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/compute-operating-points-using-custom-constraints-and-objective-functions.html">[Details]</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bounds on State Derivatives During Trimming: Constrain derivatives of model states that are not at steady state</p>
<li><p>addoutputspec Command: Add output specification to multiple operating point specification objects in an array</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<h2> R2016b </h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Batch Trimming for Parameter Variation: Vary model parameters, and compute multiple operating points using a single model compilation</p></li>
<li><p>Improved LPV System Construction: Compute operating point offsets for model inputs, outputs, states, and state derivatives during linearization</p></li>
<li><p>operspec Command: Create array of operating point specification objects</p></li>
</ul>
